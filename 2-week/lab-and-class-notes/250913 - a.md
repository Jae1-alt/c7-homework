## üåé AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS operates a global infrastructure designed for high availability and low latency.

* **Location Independence:** Your physical location isn't a constraint. You connect to AWS's global data centers, and it's not necessary to be in the same geographic region as the resources you create.
* **Managed Services:** AWS data centers are fully staffed to maintain, manage, and secure the underlying infrastructure, including databases and compute resources.
* **Compliance:** AWS adheres to numerous compliance frameworks (e.g., FedRAMP, HIPAA, GDPR, ISO 27001) for governmental, industry-specific, regional, and general security requirements, as well as operational and physical security standards.

### The AWS Infrastructure Hierarchy

AWS infrastructure is organized hierarchically to provide isolation and resilience.

* **Regions:** These are broad geographic areas, fully isolated from one another (100% isolation). Each Region contains multiple Availability Zones and is named with a standard format like `<geographic-area>-<subarea>-<region-number>` (e.g., `us-east-1` for N. Virginia).
* **Availability Zones (AZs):** These are logical groupings of tightly coupled physical data centers within a Region. While AZs aim for high isolation, a failure in one data center within an AZ can sometimes affect others within the same AZ, meaning full isolation isn't guaranteed at this level. AZs offer very low-latency connections between their data centers.

## üñ•Ô∏è EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

EC2 is AWS's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering that provides scalable compute capacity (processors, memory, storage via EBS).

* **Virtual Machines:** EC2 instances are essentially virtual machines (VMs).
* **User-Managed Dependencies:** EC2 instances are not fully managed by AWS in terms of application-level dependencies; users must configure and manage software and dependencies on the instances themselves.
* **Zonal Resources:** EC2 instances are tied to specific Availability Zones (e.g., `us-east-1a`), not entire Regions.
* **Core Service:** Many other AWS services operate on EC2 instances "behind the scenes."

### Common EC2 Terminology

* **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** A pre-configured template (like an OS image and basic software) used to launch EC2 instances.
* **Instance Type:** Defines the hardware specifications of the instance (e.g., vCPUs, memory, network performance).

## üåê Networking

Networking in AWS establishes communication pathways for your cloud resources. A network is simply a group of computers that can talk to each other.

### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Your VPC is your own private network slice within AWS.

* **Private Network:** It's your exclusive, isolated segment of the AWS cloud, similar to your home network but for cloud resources.
* **Regional Scope:** VPCs are **Regional Resources**; they exist within a specific AWS Region and cannot span across multiple Regions. The terms "VPC" and "network" can often be used interchangeably in AWS.

### Subnets

Subnets are smaller segments of your VPC, enabling logical separation and control.

* **Zonal Resources:** Subnets are **Zonal**; they exist within a single Availability Zone inside your VPC.
* **Segmentation:** They allow you to break down your VPC into smaller, manageable segments for isolation.
* **Access Control:** You can control which resources can access the internet and which remain private.

### Security Groups

Security Groups act as a stateful firewall for your resources (e.g., EC2 instances), controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

* **Network Security:** They provide network security by defining what specific traffic (protocol, port, source/destination IP) is allowed.
* **L3/L4/L5 Firewall:** They function as Layer 3/Layer 4 protocol firewalls with Layer 5 awareness for stateful connections.
* **Regional Scope:** Security Groups are **Regional Resources** scoped to specific VPCs; a Security Group in one VPC cannot be used in another.
* **Service Traffic:** They do not control traffic for certain AWS-internal services (e.g., Amazon DNS, AWS DHCP).

## üìú Scripts

Shell scripts are used for bootstrapping EC2 instances, configuring them as web servers, and handling other setup tasks upon initial launch.

* **What is a Script?:** A script is a list of instructions provided via the Command Line Interface (CLI) to automate tasks. In this context, **Bash** is the typical language used.
* **User Data:** This is an AWS-specific term for scripts that an EC2 instance's operating system (Linux only) executes automatically upon initial creation.
* **Bootstrapping:** The process of setting up a server with a startup script (also known as a startup script).

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Instructions & Troubleshooting (Click-Ops Example)

The provided lab instructions demonstrate a manual, "click-ops", process to launch an EC2 instance with an HTTP web server, highlighting common issues and their resolutions.

### Deployment Steps (Manual)

1.  **Security Group Creation:** Manually create a Security Group in the console. Define an inbound HTTP (port 80 TCP) rule from `0.0.0.0/0` and verify outbound rules allow all traffic.
2.  **Startup Script:** Copy a chosen shell script (e.g., one that installs `httpd` and sets up an `index.html` page).
3.  **Launch EC2 Instance:** Use the EC2 launch wizard.
    * Configure **Name and Tags**.
    * Select an **AMI** (e.g., Amazon Linux 2023).
    * Choose an **Instance Type** (e.g., `t3.micro`).
    * Select "Proceed without key pair" for SSH.
    * In **Network Settings**, ensure "Auto-assign public IP" is enabled and **select your manually created Security Group** (not "launch-wizard" defaults).
    * In **Advanced Settings**, paste the startup script into the "User Data" section.
    * Review and **Launch Instance**.
4.  **Test Web Server:** After instance passes status checks, navigate to `http://<instance-public-DNS-address>` in a web browser. (Crucially, use `http://` for unencrypted traffic).

### Common Troubleshooting Issues

* **URL Issues:** Incorrect protocol (`https://` instead of `http://`) or using a private DNS address.
* **Security Group:** Missing inbound HTTP (port 80) rule from `0.0.0.0/0`, or incorrect outbound rules.
* **User Data Script:** Errors in the script or incorrect pasting.
* **Networking:** Incorrect VPC selection, a broken Default VPC (e.g., deleted IGW), or disabled auto-assign public IP.

### Teardown

To avoid incurring charges, terminate the EC2 instance and optionally delete the Security Group after the lab.
